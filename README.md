# MEMORY GAME

A classic Memory Game. üÉè Find the matching cards. üÉè

## Getting Started

You can get a local copy of the project by running this command on your console:
```
git clone https://github.com/hkfrei/memoryGame.git
```
After that, you should have a new directory named "memoryGame". Enter it by typing...
`cd memoryGame`.


### Prerequisites

The project needs the package manager [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)


### Installing

While in the newly created folder, install all the dependencies.
```zsh
npm install
```

After that, you can start a development server. If you have PHP installed you can type...
```zsh
php -S localhost:8000
```
Open your Browser at `http://localhost:8000` and you are ready to go.

### Instructions
If you click on a card, it show's it's Symbol. The goal of the game is to open two cards in a row with the same symbol. If the Symbols do not match, the Cards close and you have to memory the symbol in your head for a later try. Do so, until all cards are opened. On the first card click a timer starts. It stops, when are cards are opened. The faster you are and the less moves you need, the better the result. ü•á
